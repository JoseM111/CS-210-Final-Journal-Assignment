# CS-210-Final-Journal-Assignment
A repository for showing my work to employers

* Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
<br>I was task to create a banking app that would calculate the interest rate with an initial deposit and without an initial deposit.

* What did you do particularly well?
<br>I was able to adapt a less C++ approach to the project by just depending on simple OOP code logic. Once i removed the complexity of thinking i needed a bunch of C++ logic and approached it in a more Java/Kotlin manner, the only difficult part was making the display UI render correctly.

* Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I would have used another programming language all together but the fact that i push through in C++ amazes me.

* Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
<br>The user interface was a bit complex. It required a lot of manual designing and comprehending how much space this text needed to be from another. 
* What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

* How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
<br>I used the KISS(KEEP IT SIMPLE STUPID) approach. I was going to use smart pointers and all this complex logic, that i just ended up using two objects. One to handle the logic of the program and another to render the UI of the program.
